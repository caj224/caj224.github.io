## About Me

I'm Caleb, a Financial Engineering Master's student at Lehigh University. I’m currently a Quantitative Analyst Intern at Chatham Financial, where I support fixed income and risk management strategies through data-driven analysis. Outside of my internship, I’m actively working on a research project exploring price dynamics and detection mechanisms within pump-and-dump schemes on the Solana blockchain — combining my interests in crypto, data mining, and coding. I’m passionate about building tools and strategies that turn complex data into actionable insights.

## Career Objectives

I'm passionate about applying mathematics, programming, and data analysis to financial markets. My goal is to contribute to a dynamic quantitative trading team where I can develop and deploy data-driven strategies, explore market inefficiencies, and continuously learn from ever-evolving market behavior. I’m particularly drawn to the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and real-time decision-making, and I’m eager to grow into a role where research and execution go hand-in-hand.

Outside of of school, I like to spend my time thinking strategically and competitively. I've logged over 200 hours in live low-stakes cash games with a win rate above 10 big blinds per hour, backed by focused study and disciplined play. In online chess, I’ve reached a 2200 rating by consistently refining my calculation and pattern recognition. Both games challenge me to make high-quality decisions under pressure—something I enjoy and value in competitive environments like trading. When I'm not using my right brain, I am probably playing jazz trumpet, tending to my saltwater reef aquarium, or watching NBA basketball.
