## About Me

I'm Caleb, a Financial Engineering Master's student at Lehigh University. I’m currently a Quantitative Analyst Intern at Chatham Financial, where I support fixed income and risk management strategies through data-driven analysis. Outside of my internship, I’m actively working on a research project exploring price dynamics and detection mechanisms within pump-and-dump schemes on the Solana blockchain — combining my interests in crypto, data mining, and coding. I’m passionate about building tools and strategies that turn complex data into actionable insights.

Outside of of school, I like to spend my time thinking strategically and competitively. I've logged over 200 hours in live low-stakes cash games with a win rate above 10 big blinds per hour, backed by focused study and regular correspondence with professionals. In chess, I’ve reached an online peak of 2200 and took 2nd Place in my first ever OTB tournament in Pittsburg. Both games challenge me to make high-quality decisions under pressure—something I enjoy and value in competitive environments like trading. When I'm not using my right brain, I am probably playing jazz trumpet, tending to my saltwater reef aquarium, or watching NBA basketball.
